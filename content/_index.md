## About EuSSI

Research software is an essential  output in different research domains and
needs to be reproducible and extendable throughout future research. Achieving
this requires shared principles and know-how among researchers and research
institutes. The European Software Sustainability Infrastructure (EuSSI)
consortium aims towards identifying  key elements and providing common grounds
to achieve such a goal in European level. Partners in the EuSSI consortium are
all involved - in one way or another - in research software and share a common
interest in improving the general quality of research software. This includes
various aspects such as the availability of software in the future and the
ability to reuse software beyond the project for which it was created.
