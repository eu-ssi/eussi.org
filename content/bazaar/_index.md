### About this event
The European Software Sustainability Infrastructure (EuSSI) is a network of partners involved - in one way or another - in research software and share a common interest in improving the general quality of research software.

As part of its vision aiming to support research software sustainability across Europe and beyond, partners contribute to events and organise workshops on specific topics. One of the workshops is the “Training Bazaar” to leverage exchange and open the door for an intensified collaboration between organisations involved in research software training.
